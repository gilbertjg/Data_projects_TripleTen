### Introduction

The project uses historical data to analyze factors affecting gold recovery and create a predictive model to improve mining efficiency.

---

### Data

- **Source:** Historical gold recovery data from Zyfra.  
- **Key Features:** Ore types, reagents, and recovery rates.  
- **Target:** Gold recovery percentage.  
- **Preprocessing:** Handled missing data and scaled features.

---

### Methodology

1. Cleaned & explored data.  
2. Tested regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).  
3. Evaluated models using RMSE.  
4. Tuned model hyperparameters for better performance.

---

### Results

- The best model achieved an RMSE of **X.XX**.  
- Key factors influencing recovery rates were identified, aiding process optimization.

---

### Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- XGBoost
